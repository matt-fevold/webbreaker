### Usage `usage`
Webbreaker utilizes a structure of upper-level and lower-level commands to enable interaction with multiple 3rd party platforms. The two platforms currently supported are WebInspect and Fortfiy and they can be accessed using their respective upper-level commands. Webbreaker supports multiple functions for each platform which are accessed via lower-level commands. The current command structure is listed below.

- webbreaker
    - webinspect
        - scan
        - servers
        - list
        - download
        - proxy
    - fortify
        - list
        - upload
        - scan
        - download
    - admin
        - credentials
        - clear
    - threadfix
        - list
        - teams
        - applications
        - scans
        - upload
        - create_app

A proper Webbreaker command utilizes the structure 'webbreaker [webinspect|fortify|threadfix|admin] [lower-level command] [OPTIONS]'

### Logging `logging`
WebBreaker local logs may be found under `~/.webbreaker/logs` and can be implemented with Elastic Stack for log aggregation. Recommended compenents include Filebeat agents installed on all WebInspect servers, forwarding to Logstash, and visualized in Kibana. General implementation details are [here](https://qbox.io/blog/welcome-to-the-elk-stack-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana/).  A recommended approach is to tag log events and queries with ```WebInspect``` and ```webbreaker```, but remember 
queries are case sensitive.

### Docker `docker`
Run WebBreaker in Docker from the repository's root directory, the pre-configured virtualenv environments are `venv27` for Python 2.7 or `venv36` for Python 3.6.  Examples are illustrated below.

```
docker build -t test_env:centos . \
&& docker create -it --name test_env test_env:centos  \
&& docker start test_env \
&& docker exec -it test_env bash
```
To remove the environment gracefully, perform the following command:
```
docker stop test_env && docker rm test_env
```

### Testing `testing`
Our automated testing is performed with tox and detox on Python 3.6 and 2.7.

#### Requirements
1. Be in your project root to run tests. 
    * ```pip install -rrequirements.txt```
2. Python2.7 and Python3.6 are currently tested in our tox.ini file
    * If you want to test it against your current version python, you can the other ways to test. Tox is 
    suggested though. 
    
#### Tox
We use detox instead of tox for the speed of concurrent testing. With the speed of testing, comes a lack of 
coverage output
* ```detox```

Tox will allow you to see the coverage.py results.
* ```tox```

#### Other ways to test
These can test against your version of python without creating seperate virtualenv. For isolation of issues 
and ease of use it is suggested that you use tox. 
```
python setup.py install
pytest
```
```
python setup.py install
python setup.py test
```

### Notifications
WebBreaker provides notifications or email for start-scan and end-scan events. 

The email notifier merges the provided event data into an HTML email message and sends the message. All SMTP-related 
settings are managed under your user's home directory within the `~.webbreaker/config.ini`, and read during the webbreaker execution.

If an error occurs on behalf of the notifiers at any point during the process of creating or sending 
notifications, the event will be logged, without any interruption of WebBreaker execution or the WebInspect scan.

## Configuration

Below is the default config.ini that is set at first time install, once you execute `webbreaker` for the first time.  All subsequent installs and updates will not update your `~/.webbreaker/config.ini` unless it is deleted.  You will need to modify the appropriate sections to your environment specifications.

### [threadFix]
##### host
Threadfix host that will be used.

##### api_key
This api_key to authenticate ThreadFix actions

### [fortify]
Fortify SSC settings can be found under [fortify]

##### application_name
Static Value of the default Fortify SSC Application you wish to use without stating it on the command line.

##### verify_ssl
Option to verify ssl or not while communicating with Fortify. The default option is 'False'.

##### ssc_url

Fortify username that will be used for authentication with ssc_url. It is stored using an encrypted value. Use 
`webbreaker admin credentials --fortify` to set your username & password.

##### password
Fortify username that will be used for authentication with ssc_url. It is stored using an encrypted value. Use 
`webbreaker admin credentials --fortify` to set your username & password.

##### business_risk_ranking
Fortify defaults this to `High`. Other valid inputs are `Medium` & `Low`.

##### development_phase
Current development phase of Fortify Version. Default is `Active`.

##### development_strategy
Development staffing strategy used for this Application. Default is `Internal`.

##### accessibility
The level of recommended access required to interact with this Application. Default is `externalpublicnetwork`.

##### project_template
Static value of the Fortify SSC Project Template you wish to set as a default for each Application Version you create.

##### custom_attribute_id

##### custom_attribute_value
If you would like to set another attribute definition with a custom value for creation of a new Application Version.

##### search_expression
If this is set, it will attempt to retrieve the Application Attribute Definition and use that ID in setting Version Attributes.
The format for creating a search_expression is `name:"Search Example"`

##### attribute_definition_id
Instead of using the search expression to retrieve the Application Attribute Definition, you may set it here and the search_expression will be ignored.

##### version_attribute_value
Attribute value that is set when setting Version Attributes. The default is `New WebBreaker Application`

##### version_attribute_values
List of Version attribute values to set while setting Version Attributes.

### [webinspect]

WebInspect scan configuration files for `policies` are versioned and hosted from a GIT repository configured 
in `~/.webbreaker/config.ini`.  Additionally, all WebInspect policies and servers are managed from this 
configuration file.  

All WebInspect distributions are packaged with a `Default.xml` setting file that may be overridden and uploaded 
to the WebInspect deployment with the webbreaker option `--settings`.  The setting xml file contains 
all possible options for your scan, including a WebInspect scan including policy, workflow and/or login 
macro, scan depth, and allowed hosts.

#### server_XX and endpoint_XX
Provides a _Just-In-Time_ (JIT) scheduler provides the ability to load balance a WebInspect cluster for scans.

#### webinspect_size
Sets the number for large and small WebInspect scan servers. This assists with _Just-In-Time_ (JIT) scheduling

#### webinspect_repo
A unique GIT repo is defined by the user and is mutually exclusive from the WebBreaker source.  The 
assumption is each WebBreaker installation will have a unique GIT URL defined.  Upon each execution, 
the repo refreshes *all* settings file(s), assuming that there may be newly created, deletions, or modifications 
of settings files.  All settings files used in execution must reside in this respective repo 
under `~/.webbreaker/etc/webinspect/settings`.

#### username
Basic authentication with `.htaccess` syntax configured on your WebInspect server

If authentication is set to true, all WebInspect requests will use basic auth. A user will be prompted for
credentials which, if valid, will be encrypted and saved. Credentials can also be set via the
`webbreaker admin credentials --webinspect` command.

#### password
Basic authentication with `.htaccess` syntax configured on your WebInspect server

### [webinspect_policy]
Grouping of proprietary WebInspect tests to perform.  Tests or rules are represented in an `xml` element with 
a `.policy` file extension.  Custom tests or Checks are mapped to a unique WebInspect ID.  The mapping for all 
policies shipped with WebInspect are mapped with their respective GUID within this section.

*Note:* All custom polices are automatically uploaded to the targeted WebInspect server and must be referenced 
as a GUID.  

### email
Notifications for start-scan and end-scan events. A simple publisher/subscriber pattern is implemented under 
the "notifiers" folder.

A Reporter object holds a collection of Notifier objects, each of which implements a Notify function responsible 
for creating the desired notification. Currently, two notification types are implemented email and database.

The email notifier merges the provided event data into an HTML email message and sends the message. All 
SMTP-related settings are stored in .emailrc, and read during program startup.
